-  Direct messages are separate accounts instead of being a tweet

   -  less cost on for dms
   -  `recipient` on tweet account becomes obsolete

-  Comment functionality

## Tests

How to install the prerequisites to run an anchor program, is nicely explained in the [anchor book][1].

Having the prerequisites out of the way, the `yarn` command will load some program dependencies.

To then be able to run the tests: change the destination of **`wallet`** under the `[provider]` section in the `Anchor.toml` file according to your systems configuration. 
Usually, it should be enough to change the home path.

Building and running the test happens with `anchor test`.

To use the tests while working on a frontend run the localnet with `anchor localnet`.<br>
In another terminal airdrop your wallet some SOL and load the test `solana airdrop 1000 <YourPhantomWalletPubKey> && anchor run test`.

### Tested functionalities

```
❯ anchor test
